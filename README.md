Two Sets for Machine Learning for Breast Cancer Risk Prediction

######## Set 1:...................................................................................................................................................
# First Set of Machine Learning for Breast Cancer Risk Prediction focused on Hyperparameter Tuning

######## Set 2:...................................................................................................................................................
### 1.	Please save the given Jupyter file and the Excel file in the same folder.
### 2.	You need to have an Excel file named breast_cancer_bd.csv and fix its path in cells #2 and #3 and last cell based on where you save the given Excel file.
### The last cell is a comprehensive program that combines machine learning with a graphical user interface (GUI) to predict whether a breast cancer cell sample is benign or malignant based on several features. 
### It uses the K-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm and a Tkinter interface for user interaction. Enjoy it!
